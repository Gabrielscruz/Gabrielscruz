## 📝 About Me

I'm a senior software engineer with 7+ years of experience, focused on building real solutions that improve processes, performance, and user experience.

I started my journey in MIS, where I spent around 3 years managing operations, leading teams, analyzing performance, and ensuring everything ran smoothly in the fast-paced call center environment.  
This background gave me strong skills in leadership, data analysis, communication, and strategic thinking — all of which I apply daily in development.

Today, I build complex systems at **Thinkin**, including:

- Monitoring Platforms  
- Study & Training Platforms  
- Internal Social Network  
- Real-time Chat  
- Automations & ETL pipelines  
- Internal tooling and system optimizations  

I enjoy creating things that have real impact — whether requested or developed by initiative to make processes better. I love seeing results.

Currently working with:

- **Next.js**
- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker & NGINX**
- **Python (Selenium, Pandas, DuckDB, ETL)**

I'm the type who learns fast and applies immediately. I’ve completed multiple formations from Rocketseat, Alura, and other platforms, covering Node, React, React Native, DevOps, and even Machine Learning.

I enjoy collaboration, sharing knowledge, and growing together as a team.
